# Rust Gameboy emulator

## Brief note
Welcome to yet another one of my pet projects. Recently, I've found that I wanted to get deeper into hardware emulation, as it is a practical, tangible way to get exposure to working with low level systems.
The end result of this project will consist of a core library which emulates the original Gameboy, and a UI which allows users to run the gameboy in a browser leveraging WebAssembly.

## Development Resources
Here are some very helpful resources I've compiled for this project
